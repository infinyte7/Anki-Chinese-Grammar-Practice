# Anki-Chinese-Grammar-Practice
Practice Chinese language grammar.

Cards contain example sentence from AllSet Learning's Chinese Grammar Wiki. I used existing anki deck [Visit](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/782551504). It contains A1 to C1 (HSK1 to HSK5).

### Note: The deck will updated regularly.

## Quick start
Download Anki deck from ankiweb and import it in Anki or Ankidroid.

## Disclaimer
I used existing [deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/782551504) data for developing this. I have removed and edited some sentences.
There is no audio file.

Some sentences may be correct but due to order in sentences it may show incorrect.
For ex:-
<br>我不知道她。
<br>and
<br>她不知道我。

Both sentences are correct. But after clicking 'check' button, it will show answer according to order of characters in the sentences.

## For adding sentences to deck
Cards have following fields
```
{{中文}}
{{Pinyin}}
{{English}}
...
{{Splitted}} //--> it store chinese sentence with space between characters. It is generated using [jieba] (https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba).
```
Add value to respective fields but it should be noted, {{Splitted}} field must contain sentences with spaces between characters.
For ex:-
<br>我 不 知道 她 。
<br>用 手机 学习 汉语 。
